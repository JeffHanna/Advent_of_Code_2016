2016 Advent of Code puzzle 01-02.

Then, you notice the instructions continue on the back of the Recruiting 
Document. Easter Bunny HQ is actually at the first location you visit twice.
For example, if your instructions are R8, R4, R4, R8, the first location you 
visit twice is 4 blocks away, due East.
How many blocks away is the first location you visit twice?

PERSONAL NOTES:
* Assume a 2D grid, +Y is 'North' and +X is 'East'.
* Assume you start at ( 0, 0 ) facing down the +Y axis (aka North).
* At each loop iteration the direction (L or R) will need to be converted to
  a new vector (-X, +X, -Y, or +Y) depending on the current facing.
